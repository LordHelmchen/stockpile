ComputerCraft program to auto-stock craftable items in an AppliedEnergistics network

## Setup

#### Step 1: Connect an ME Interface to the back of a computer

* Make sure it's facing **the back of the computer**!  It can't be placed on any other side.
* Make sure it's a cubic interface (don't use the panel version)
* Wrench it until the arrow points at the computer
* Obviously the interface should be connected to your network :)

Example:

#### Step 2: Install the program!

This installer will download everything you need:

```
pastebin run uiLyaRFz
```

When it's running, it should look something like this:
